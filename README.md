# COMP-6999-Masters-Project

### abstract
The online exam system has grown popularity over countries because of its adaptability, user-friendliness, and candidates' ability to take the exam remotely. According to the research community, the major challenge in the online exam is the proctoring technique. Since there is no rule-based proctoring system, it opens new opportunities for defrauding and accessing internet resources for reference during an exam. 

Ironically, none of the proctoring systems monitor the students' network traffic (inbound and outbound) contents, which they access, and this motivates us to question what sort of proctoring application can automate the proctoring process using some predefined rules and observe traffic contents during an examination.

In this project, our developed proctoring system offers a novel way to automate the proctoring process and detect fraudulent activity during an online exam by intercepting network inbound and outbound traffic content using MITMproxy  and analyze it with Natural Language Processing. To test our application's feasibility, we applied several flexible proctoring rules and sample exam questions to enforce proctoring rules using content analysis to limit the access resources. In most testing situations, the proctoring application performs better if the exam question is a sequence of words or a sentence rather than complicated mathematical or chemical reaction related questions.
